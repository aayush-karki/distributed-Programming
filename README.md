# Distributed Programming

This is a collection of distributed programming problem that I solved while learning more about hadoop and spark.

## Folder structure
A folder is dedicated to a problem. Each problem folder contains:
- a .py or .scala file ( 2 .py files if a problem is solved using haddop).  
- a image file showing the output.
- if applicable a text file containing the output. 
- if applicable a text file containing the input. *If a folder does not contain a input file then the input file is likely a UCI dataset which is stored in dataSet folder.*
